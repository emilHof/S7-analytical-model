%% calculations

t_1 = 1; % 24 hrs

% convert to seconds
t_s = t_1 * 60 * 60;

data_tIn = t_s * (gps.resolution * gps.sampleRate + salinity.resolution * salinity.sampleRate) / 8 / 1000000;    %MB/h

data_tOut = t_s * xBeeProSX.maxTransRate / 8 / 1000;     %MB/h

%% simulation
% we simulate an operational day of the buoy
% the sensors run continuously and the radio wakes every 1 hr to empty the
% hard drive
% to find the total current draw over the entire 24 hours we calculate it
% for 1 hr and then multiply the total by 24

% set time parameter
t_total = 24; % hrs
t_total_s = t_total * 60 * 60; %converts the total time interval into seconds
t_intr = 1; % this denotes the time interval for which we will be calculating the current draw
t_intr_s = t_intr * 60 * 60; % this is the time interval but converted to seconds

% to find the amount of data collected over one hour we use the data in
% value from the calculations
data = t_intr_s * (gps.resolution * gps.sampleRate + salinity.resolution * salinity.sampleRate) / 1000;    % kb

% to find the current drawn by the sensors over one hour we use this
% function
currentSensors_intr = (gps.currentDraw + salinity.currentDraw) * t_intr;    % mAh

% to find the current draw of the radio we calculate how long it would take
% to empty the drive after one hour and multiply that value by the sending current
% draw of the radio 
% we then add that value to the idle current draw of the radio multiplied
% by the remaining time in an hour
radioOnTime = data / xBeeProSX.maxTransRate;    % s
radioOffTime = t_intr_s - radioOnTime          % s
radioOnTime_hr = radioOnTime / 60 / 60;         % hrs
currentRadioSending_intr = xBeeProSX.currentTrans * radioOnTime_hr;         % mAh
currenRadiotIdle_intr = xBeeProSX.currentIdle * (t_intr - radioOnTime_hr);  % mAh

% to find the current drawn by the motherboard over that hour we multiply
% its max current draw by the sending time interval and its idle current
% draw by the remaining interval time
% we then add those values
currentMotherboardSending_intr = odroidN2plus.currentMax * radioOnTime_hr;          % mAh
currentMotherbaordIdle_intr = odroidN2plus.currentIdle * (t_intr - radioOnTime_hr); % mAh

% now we can calculate the total current draw over one time interval by
% adding all the current draw values
currentTotal_intr = currentSensors_intr + currentRadioSending_intr + currenRadiotIdle_intr + currentMotherboardSending_intr + currentMotherbaordIdle_intr %mAh

% to get the total discharge of the battery over the whole time period we
% multiply the interval total by the whole time
chargeLost = @(t) currentTotal_intr * t; %mAh

% now we plot this function

% to find how much hard drive storage is used up over time, we take the
% we assume that the data that is being sent to shore is not deleted from
% the drive
% to plot the storage in use over time we take data_In and plot it over
% time (t) in hours, as data_In is in MB/h
dataStored = @(t) data_tIn * t;     % MB/h

%now this is plotted as well

%% more detailed look at the current draw

        chargeUsed = chargeUsed + idleDrawOverall;  %
        chargeUsedOverTime(i + j) = chargeUsed;
